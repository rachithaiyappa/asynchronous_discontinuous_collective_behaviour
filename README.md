# asynchronous_discontinuous_collective_behaviour
This repository contains Fortran 95 code for the model described in the paper "Disentangling and modeling interactions in fish with burst-and-coast swimming reveal distinct alignment and attraction behaviors" by Calovi et al. 2018. This is NOT the code released by the authors of the paper. Instead, it is a part my summer project with them which l continued into my Master's Thesis

# notes
1. The file names are titled with a personal bias to be in sync with the namin in personal workspaces and other repositories. Do not make any correlation between the file names and what the function does unless explicitly mentioned.
